# AI-Powered Automated Presentation Generator

An end-to-end Python pipeline that transforms any topic into a professional 7-slide PowerPoint presentation by conducting real-time web research and leveraging LLM orchestration.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Research:** Uses the DuckDuckGo Search API to find the latest information on any topic.
- **Deep Web Scraping:** Implements `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium` to extract high-fidelity content from web pages.
- **LLM Orchestration:** Utilizes Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to synthesize search results into a structured presentation format.
- **Automated Design:** Uses `python-pptx` to programmatically generate slides with optimized layouts.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `GEN_AI.ipynb`: The core Jupyter Notebook containing the research and generation logic.
- `*_Presentation.pptx`: Sample presentations generated by the tool (e.g., Climate Change, Corruption in India).

## 📋 How It Works
1. **User Input:** Provide a topic through the notebook interface.
2. **Search & Scrape:** The system scrapes top web results for up-to-date context.
3. **Synthesis:** Gemini processes the text into a Title, Overview, 4 Key Points, and Conclusion.
4. **Generation:** A `.pptx` file is created and saved locally in the project folder.
